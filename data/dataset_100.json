Subtract the area of the windows and door: 384 - (2*(3*4) + 3*7) = 384 - (24 + 21) = 339 square feet. Since two coats are needed, double the area: 339 * 2 = 678 square feet. Each gallon covers 350 square feet, so Emily needs 678 / 350 = 1.937 gallons, which rounds up to 2 gallons. Therefore, Emily needs to buy 2 gallons of paint.",
